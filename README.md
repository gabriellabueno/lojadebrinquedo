# Toy Box :gift: :teddy_bear: :yo_yo:

This project is a website for a kids toy store, made for the "Software Engineering Lab" subject. The website fetches information, such as product details, pricing, and availability, from a database through a backend API implemented in Java. It ensures dynamic functionality by integrating the frontend with the backend, allowing real-time retrieval and display of data stored in the MySQL database.
